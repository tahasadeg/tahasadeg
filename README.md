👨‍💻 Taha Sadeg | Libyan Developer & IT Enthusiast

🌟 About Me:
I'm Taha Sadeg, a passionate Libyan student and developer, currently on a journey with Individual Solutions, an IT company offering a range of services. My interest in technology started at a young age and has only grown stronger since then.

💼 Experience:
At Individual Solutions, I started as a customer service agent, but my enthusiasm and quick learning led me to become a system administrator within just one week. Since then, I've been involved in various aspects of the company's business, particularly in sales and project management. Engaging in these areas has not only honed my public speaking and critical thinking skills but has also broadened my perspective.

🚀 Journey into Development:
My journey into development began with CMS-based web development, where I built several websites for clients using platforms like WordPress. Seeking more depth, I delved into PHP web apps, taking courses and completing my first solo PHP project recently, using PURE PHP for the backend and HTML/CSS for the frontend. I've also gained experience in hosting with Enginx and FastCGI, as well as in virtualization with VMware.

📈 Sales & Project Management:
Aside from development, I've had considerable experience in sales and project management. Notably, I closed a deal with the largest ISP in Libya and single-handedly implemented a ticketing system for them. I've also showcased our services at the Libyan IT Expo and successfully sold our solutions multiple times.

🔍 Looking Ahead:
My journey has been diverse and enriching, and I'm constantly seeking new challenges and opportunities to learn and grow as a developer and IT professional. I'm excited to contribute to the world of technology and make a positive impact.
